## üìå Introduction

This project demonstrates a custom video compression pipeline using:
- **Block-based motion compensation**
- **K-means clustering**
- **Residual frame encoding**

The objective is to reduce the video file size while maintaining visual quality, evaluated using **Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)**. The techniques used are similar in spirit to modern video codecs like H.264 and HEVC.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Techniques and Workflow

### 1. Video Initialization
- Video is loaded using `cv2.VideoCapture()`.
- Block size: `16x16`
- Number of clusters for K-means: `5`
- Only the first 60 seconds (‚âà1440 frames at 24 fps) are processed.

### 2. Frame Division
- Each frame is split into 16√ó16 pixel blocks.
- This granularity simplifies motion tracking and compression.

### 3. K-means Clustering
- Each block's average color is computed.
- K-means is applied to reduce frame complexity by grouping similar blocks.

### 4. Motion Compensation
- **Diamond Search Algorithm** used for block-based motion vector calculation between consecutive frames.
- Captures motion to allow inter-frame compression.

### 5. Compression Pipeline
For each frame, the following components are saved:
- Cluster assignments (block-wise)
- Motion vectors (motion model)
- Residual frame (difference between original and predicted)
- Frame metadata (shape, block size)

### 6. Decompression
- Motion vectors are applied to predict frame content.
- Residual frame is added to recover the original frame.

### 7. Refresh Mechanism
- Reference frames are updated every 4 frames to limit error propagation and enhance video quality.

## üìà Performance Evaluation

- **Metric:** PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)
- PSNR is computed for each reconstructed frame.
- A higher PSNR value indicates better visual fidelity.

---

## üìä Results

- The method successfully compresses video while maintaining good playback quality.
- Average PSNR across frames indicates satisfactory performance for practical use cases such as streaming or storage.

## üîö Conclusion

This project showcases a foundational video compression method combining unsupervised learning and motion estimation. Future improvements could include:
- Experimenting with alternative clustering techniques
- Adaptive block sizes
- Advanced motion compensation models
